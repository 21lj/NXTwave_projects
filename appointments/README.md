## âš  Challenges Faced & Solutions
1. **Dynamic routing with React Router**: Initially had issues with `useParams`. Solved by ensuring correct route setup in `App.js`.
2. **Form validation**: Handled manually using state and error messages for simplicity.
3. **Responsive image layout**: Used Bootstrap grid and `object-fit` to keep doctor images consistent.
4. **State management without Redux**: Used local state effectively with `useState`, which was sufficient for this scale.
